This is a list of the parties who in some way inspired or motivated me to develop associations.  I will attempt to sort them according to their degree of impact, though the exact order may not be one hundred percent accurate.

1) Japan
2) Heinlein
3) Tolkien
4? Mike Cernovich
4? Michael Malice
4? Andrew Torba
4? Connor James Webb
5? An eclectic collection of (current/former) YouTube Channels
5? Stefan Molyneux (Technically could be included in the above)
6) The Psychotic War Criminals Running My Country

Also, God is somewhere in this list, or maybe everywhere, not sure.
