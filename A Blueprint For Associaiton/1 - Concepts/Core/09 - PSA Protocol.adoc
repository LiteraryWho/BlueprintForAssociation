This is just a list of random suggestions I have for the PSA Protocol, which, to be clear, is the rules for how associations interact with each other, and the set of common principles which all member associations agree to hold.  It is designed by the PSA Council.

Anyway, on to the suggestions, in no particular order (hopefully I end up with more than two, lol).
1) Association employees cannot be members of the association they work for.  The idea behind this is to limit an associations power over their employees, so management will be directly accountable to the PSA council.  It should also encourage a bit more competition.

It might be worth it for them to also use staking associations, since the greater flexibility might smooth over some of the difficulties of running an association.

2) For property rights, it may be worthwhile to base it more on utilization, rather than title.  Put another way, if Alice has a fancy slip of paper that says “I own Nebraska,” but Bob turned it into a farm while Alice wasn’t paying attention, we would consider Bob to be the rightful owner.  That’s not to say I wouldn’t suggest “wilderness preserve” be a valid use for land, but simply that it would require something a bit more than someone’s say so.

For instance, if Alice had park rangers patrolling the forest, scientists studying it, and was doing fire management (etc., etc.), then even if it looked (and basically was) totally wild, we would still consider Alice to be the rightful owner.

The purpose of this is to discourage people from squatting on valuable property without putting it to good use, while still allowing people who value nature to be able to do something about it.

3) It might be best to require or encourage in some way soldiers/guards/etc. to be part of a Staking Association.  This gives society significant leverage, which should encourage responsible behavior.
