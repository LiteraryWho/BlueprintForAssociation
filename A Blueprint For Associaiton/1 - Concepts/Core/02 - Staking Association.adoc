A Staking Association is a kind of Private Social Association which uses productive assets as the underlying guarantee for the good behavior of its members.  More specifically, it acts as a holding company for the assets of some given association, and those assets are then held by the association for the duration of the relevant contract.  To further elaborate, allow me to provide a short hypothetical scenario.

Alice is interested in renting an apartment from Bob.  Bob, not being familiar with Alice, and not willing to risk that she might damage his property without paying for the repairs (or perhaps abscond with the appliances), would prefer to have some means of securing responsible behavior from her.  To this end, he requires her lease to be handled through an association.

In this case, they decide to use a Staking Association (the costs and benefits of different types of associations will depend on market realities and entrepreneurial vision, though I will make a few predictions later), which we’ll call Alpha.  Alpha Association utilizes some metric, based on the cost of Bob’s apartment, Alice’s character, and/or some other variety of factors, to determine that ten thousand dollars worth of assets will cover their risk.

We will suppose that Alice has ten thousand dollars on hand (although if she does not, the problem is only slightly more complicated), which she agrees to allow Alpha to retain for the duration of her lease.  Alice then takes residence in Bob’s apartment, and if everything goes well, gets her ten thousand dollars back when she moves out.  She may also get some portion of the interest/dividends on her holdings as well, although whether and how much would be little more than idle speculation at this point.

If things do not go well, for instance, Alice proves to be incredibly clumsy and breaks all the windows, then at the end of her lease, Alice will be left with a choice.  Bob, of course, does not want to pay for Alice’s damage to his property, so he will insist she take responsibility.  Alice can then simply pay for new windows, and Alpha will return her money without issue, or she can attempt to flee.

Exactly what happens in this case will depend on her agreement with Alpha, but regardless, Bob will get his money from Alpha.  How difficult that might be is another question, and beside the point (although I will note, a Staking association which is notoriously difficult is unlikely to receive new customers).  Alice, on the other hand, will at the very least not be able to get her money back until Alpha recoups their losses.  Exactly what that looks like will depend entirely on the agreement between Alpha and Alice, though I can offer some speculation.

I see two ways a Staking Association might operate.  In one, the assets under their management will be considered the property of their members, and will not be able to be liquidated or transferred without the owner’s explicit consent.  In this case, the association would take a lean against those assets, and recoup their losses from the returns.  This would be especially useful if those assets happened to be real estate, or some other property which is difficult to divide or sell.  When the debt was repaid (which could possibly take generations), control of those assets would return to the rightful owner, or their estate.

The other way is that a Staking Association would prefer to clear its debts immediately, and would liquidate a member’s stake to pay for damages immediately.  This would work best for things like stocks and bonds, which are easier to sell.

I cannot say which strategy would prove dominant, as it comes down to what customers prefer, as well as what models can be made profitable.  I would guess, at least, that the former would be more popular, and may have some desirable properties if broadly applied.  In particular, if a stake is useable for multiple contracts, or as a general guarantee of responsibility, then the prospect of reclaiming ownership of it might work as an incentive to remain invested in society for individuals with severe transgressions against it.
