Or more specifically, the limits thereof.  This probably doesn’t need a whole section, but w/e, you get one, enjoy.

This is again not technically strictly related to associations, and really comes down to those market forces I keep referencing, but whatever.  This might be something worthwhile for the PSA Council to define, so I’ll mention it, and provide a suggestion.

First, what do I mean by the limits of responsibility?  Specifically, I am referring to the point where some party is no longer responsible for the consequences of their actions.  To illustrate with an example, suppose Alice punches Bob in the face (because he insulted her new hat) and breaks his nose.  She’s clearly almost or entirely fully responsible for the damage.  We would expect an arbiter to assign all of Bob’s medical bills, and some amount for his pain, suffering, and inconvenience, to Alice.

Now instead suppose that after Bob insulted her hat, Alice waves her arms in frustration.  In doing so she bumps a table umbrella, which then, through some needlessly complicated rube goldberg mechanism I don’t care to go into, results in a rubber duck striking Bob in the face, breaking his nose.  It is not clear that all the responsibility for Bob’s fate lies at Alice’s feet.  In fact it does not seem that she is very responsible at all, unless she was instrumental in the apparently unsafe in retrospect placement of all the items involved in Bob’s injury.

In a complicated scenario such as that, it would fall on Bob’s advocate (or more likely on the advocate/investigator of some third party) to determine how responsibly for the damage was to be distributed.  Of course, in this specific example, it is likely Bob would simply eat the damage in some way, likely through health insurance (who would themselves likely decide not to bother, unless Bob’s nose was unusually valuable).  That is neither here nor there, however, as there are likely to be similarly complicated problems with much more at stake, and this demonstrates the mechanism for their resolution.

In any case, although this does in some way show the limit’s of Alice’s responsibility, it is only insofar determining her share of it.  To demonstrate a more substantial limit, let us consider a more complicated scenario.

Alice is the highly charismatic leader of a cult, chock full of acolytes who cater to her every whim.  One day, while traveling with a flock of her followers, Bob makes fun of her silly hat.  Offended, Alice says, “People who insult my hat deserve to be punched in the face.”  One of the cultist traveling with her hears this, and punches Bob in the face.

In this situation, even though Alice made no command or action, she would still share a large portion of the responsibility for Bob’s injury (in addition to the cultist, of course).  Because of her position of authority, some portion of the blame would pass through to her, even if she did not intend at all for Bob to be punched in the face.  This case is actually similar to the rube goldberg situation earlier, and could likely be handled in a similar way.

On the other hand, let’s suppose that Alice is actually a smelly bum no one likes.  One day, Bob walks by and insults her hat.  Alice is so enraged by this, she grabs a piece of paper and scrawls, “Jerks who mock my hat should be punched!” onto it, then posts it to a nearby bulletin board.  Charlie happens to be nearby, and after witnessing Bob’s mockery, and reading Alice’s message, decides that actually, she is right, it’s a great hat and Bob’s a big jerk.  He punches Bob in the face, breaking his nose.

In this scenario, we would not expect an arbiter to assign any responsibility to Alice, even though getting Bob punched in the face was her intent.  This is because, although Alice provided motivation for the attack, she had no kind of authority over Charlie.  He made the decision of his own accord.  Basically, the responsibility stopped where Alice’s choice ended, and Charlie’s began.  Charlie, not being in the habit of executing Alice’s will, could not be said to be an extension of it.
