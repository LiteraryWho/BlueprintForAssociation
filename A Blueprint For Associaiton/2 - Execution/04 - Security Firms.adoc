Security with associations really won’t be that different than it is under the state for the vast majority of people.  If a person lives in an apartment, or any property with an HOA, then a contract with some reputable firm will most likely be included.  Choosing which firm will fall onto the apartment owners in the first case, and onto the board/committee in the latter.

In the event someone is not a member of a community of some kind, then they will have to make their own decision on the matter.  Because there should be a large number of competing security firms (serving the large communities), there will likely be companies who cater to single family homes/owner occupied properties/etc. or at least options from other firms.  If someone doesn’t feel the expense is worthwhile, it is entirely possible for them to handle it on their own.

In fact, in all cases (even now in our statist case), everyone is at least partially responsible for their own security, which is a fact worth remembering.  If someone is in a dangerous situation, all the police budget/security bills in the world won’t make a man who is five minutes away get there any faster.  Not that this is necessarily related to associations, I just wanted to point out that “people handle their own security” is not actually novel or unfamiliar concept.  People just ignore that fact for some reason.

Anyway, the additional part of security is a concept I call Vendetta, which is expanded upon in a chapter of the same name.  In short, it is similar to how the police today will hunt down someone who hurt your on your behalf, but formalizing the arrangement.  Security firms plus Vendetta replicates the value of modern police at least as good as the police do today, with the only catch being a person may, depending on their situation, have to think about the problem more than today.

Another objection I can see someone making is “But then only rich people will have security!”  For starters, wealthy people already get better security today, because they have greater flexibility in where the live (not counting their ability to purchase additional services on top).  For second, less wealthy people are more likely to live in apartments, which have many natural incentives to include security with the rent.

Number one, most people prefer safety, ergo, most people will not choose to live in an apartment that either a) isn’t just in a naturally very safe area, or b) doesn’t have a contract with a reputable security firm.

The second incentive has to do with their customer base.  Given that most people prefer security, it follows that only very desperate people would be interested in an unsafe, unsecured apartment.  Very desperate people are also far more likely to benefit from stealing everything that isn’t nailed down in an apartment.  If a landlord wants to secure their property from their tenants, they’ll have to hire a security firm (remember, there is no hidden subsidy in the form of public police).

If a landlord is already hiring security, they might as well offer it to their tenants, in order to compete with the other bottom tier properties.  It won’t cost them much, if any, more, and makes renting with them far more appealing.  The landlord will also be just as, if not more incentivized to hire a reputable firm, because a sketchy security guard can steal their appliances just as easily as a sketchy tenant.

There is also a responsibility angle, where in some circumstances a landlord could be found liable for damages caused by failing to hire security.  I don’t consider that to be the most dependable incentive, as it comes down to the situation and how well it can be argued in mediation.  Still, it’s another danger a landlord faces by trying to cheap out, so it is worth noting.

Additionally, because Vendetta is based on damages (and to an extent the wealth of the offender), it is likely to be accessible at all wealth levels (especially if it uses the percentage based fee I suggested).
