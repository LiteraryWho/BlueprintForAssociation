== But My X!

There are a great number of things that will be changed/removed/weakened by the transition from nations to associations, some have vast numbers of people emotionally invested into them.

I am perfectly aware of many of them (I even made a list), and actually devised some potential strategies for replicating/fixing/developing them.  I will not be talking about any of them, because I do not care.  If you have some pet cause that is of the utmost importance to you, which you feel will be adversely affected by the loss of the state, I have only one thing to say.  Solve your own problems, like an adult.

Thanks :D
Bye!

PS Is this being needlessly mean?  Maybe.  Am I too lazy to fix it right now?  Definitely
