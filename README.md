# A-Blueprint-For-Association
A practical strategy for the peaceful and permanent elimination of the state.

The numbers offer a suggested reading order, though following it is not critical to understanding the underlying concept.  At the very least, I suggest starting with number one, however, as it introduces the core idea.  Also, if you are convinced, but don't feel like reading everything, number sixteen "Execution" offers some advice for bringing this about.  It also serves as an argument for why this is more than some nebulous 'good idea', but rather is something which can actually be brought to reality in the near future.

This project is intended to be a collaborative effort, so feel free to fork this repository, or to make push requests/comments/suggestions.  I’ll try to incorporate feedback here as well.

There is also a novel which introduces the concept, which I’ll link here when I find a home for it.

If you find this idea valuable and want to support the guy who made it, you can donate monero at the following address:
